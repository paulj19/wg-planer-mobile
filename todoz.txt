1. merge login and register to single login page with tabs => maybe because login page in expo is a browser based
2. on number of rooms input => scroll up the room list to top, can be extended also to further fields
3. what if fails during the transition from create wg to register user => save wg-id in local storage?
4. imporve validation => room/task duplicates
5. reset tasks not working
6. make taking directly from cache in redux via selectFloor() work instead of passing args directly to registration page
7. enable going back to previous page in registration, wg already created so, needs to update the created wg and then pass to registration page again
8. golang server panics and exits on duplicate floor id submitted from frontend
9. not connected to the internet, toast
10. authserver redeploy => golang server cant get jwks => periodic ping?!
