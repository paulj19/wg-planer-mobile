1. merge login and register to single login page with tabs => maybe because login page in expo is a browser based
2. on number of rooms input => scroll up the room list to top, can be extended also to further fields
3. what if fails during the transition from create wg to register user => save wg-id in local storage?
4. imporve validation => room/task duplicates
5. reset tasks not working
6. make taking directly from cache in redux via selectFloor() work instead of passing args directly to registration page
7. enable going back to previous page in registration, wg already created so, needs to update the created wg and then pass to registration page again
8. golang server panics and exits on duplicate floor id submitted from frontend
9. not connected to the internet, toast
10. authserver redeploy => golang server cant get jwks => periodic ping?!



COOLIO FEATs
1. reminder avail again => when will you be back? calender and ask if available on that day?
2. remind self on this task => notification or alarm to remind in 10 hours/at 6 pm today!
3. feedback as stars and comments as feedback
4. number of reminders in feed
5. reminders number in task card clickable => who has reminded you? and message? photos(in remind button option to take photos)
6. clicking done => pop up UI like in gmeet
7. ask for help => next time it comes to him, you take it


IMP:
1. feed refresh
2. adr 1 fix, ie, "no one else available to take the task, do you want to take it?"



BEFORE PUSH:
1. remove Number from AllTasks
2. unassigned task/during creation should be -1 or when a task gets unassigned, it should be -1


BE:
1. user in context with the logs
2. auth token content in context
3. add "was assigned to you by <resident name>" or "was done by" in task notification
4. verify expo push not using receipts
5. if notification fails still after 3 times, do something like get ids of failed notifications and send them again
